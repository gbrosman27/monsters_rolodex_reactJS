//this.setState allows us to modify the properties and values on the state. 
//onClick, it will set the state to what ever we passed to it, and then re-render.
//Gives more control on what we want the components to display without altering default values.
//Anytime you use the map() function inside of render, or you have a list of the same jsx elements one after another, 
//they need a key attribute (and CRA will warn you about it if you miss it).
